# 1st AI agent to generate seismic image for interpreration

First AI agent implementation to use text to image MLLM model to generate seismic image for structures described by prompt.
It shows how AI agent to use planning, choose tools and take final action.

The input is 

"syncline fold with normal faults"

The prompt after enhancement is

"A grayscale seismic reflection profile showcasing a syncline fold structure with associated normal faults. The syncline should be represented by downward curving reflectors indicating a trough-like structure. The normal faults should be depicted as discontinuous reflectors with visible offset, indicating the displacement of rock layers due to extensional forces."

The final seismc image is
